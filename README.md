# 🧮 Console Calculator (C# .NET)

A simple **C# .NET console-based calculator** that supports basic arithmetic and advanced operations like modulus, exponentiation, and square root. Created by **Naveed (Code Holder)**.

## 📌 Features
- ➕ Addition
- ➖ Subtraction
- ✖ Multiplication
- ➗ Division (with zero-division check)
- 📏 Modulus (`%`)
- ⬆ Power (`^`)
- 📐 Square Root (`sqrt`)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites
- Install [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) (version 6.0 or later recommended)
- A code editor like [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### 3️⃣ Build and Run
dotnet build
dotnet run

## 📖 How to Use
1. Run the program.
2. Choose an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `^`, `sqrt`).
3. Enter the required number(s):
   - For **sqrt** → enter one number.
   - For **^** → enter the exponent first, then the base.
   - For all others → enter two numbers.
4. View the result.

## 🛠 Example Output
Welcome to the Calculator!
Choose an operation: +, -, *, /, %, ^, sqrt
